Create a <strong>well-documented script â€“ </strong>include names, date and purpose of the script at the head of the script, the purpose of the fields in the table, comment all code sections.<strong> Use meaningful names and consistent naming conventions throughout the script. </strong>The script should execute correctly without any syntax or logical errors or warnings.

Think of a real life scenario where a database will work well.  Further, come up with structure of one table to store relevant information about an entity in this database. You can choose something of interest to you- sports, movies, music etc.

Now code a script in SQL that satisfies the following requirements:

<ol>

 <li>Drop a database if it exists, create a database by the same name and use it.</li>

 <li>Create a table therein that stores relevant information about an entity of your choice. <strong>Choose relevant fields of BEST FIT to store data pertaining to that entity</strong>. <strong>Comment the purpose of each field.</strong> Ensure that the table has at least:</li>

</ol>




<ol>

 <li>a primary key field</li>

 <li>a field of type varchar</li>

</ol>

<ul>

 <li>a field of type char</li>

</ul>

<ol>

 <li>a field of type float or double, unsigned</li>

 <li>a field of type smallint, unsigned</li>

 <li>a field of enumerated data type</li>

</ol>

<ul>

 <li>a field of date data type</li>

 <li>at least one field that cannot contain a null value</li>

</ul>

<ol>

 <li>at least one field has a relevant default value</li>

</ol>




<ol>

 <li>Display the structure of the table.</li>

 <li>Populate the table with <strong>relevant</strong> data, at least 10 records. Text/string data in quotes and numeric without quotes</li>

 <li>Add a SELECT statement to display the data in the table.</li>

</ol>
